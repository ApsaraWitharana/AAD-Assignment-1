# Serialization and Deserialization in Java

## Introduction
Serialization is the process of converting an object's state into a byte stream, which can then be stored in a file, database, or transmitted over a network. Deserialization is the reverse process, where the byte stream is converted back into a copy of the original object. These processes are crucial for persisting the state of an object or transferring it between different parts of a system or across systems.

## Benefits
1. **Persistence:** Objects can be saved to a storage medium and restored later, preserving their state.
2. **Data Transfer:** Objects can be sent over a network, enabling distributed systems to communicate.
3. **Caching:** Objects can be serialized to cache intermediate states, improving performance.
4. **Deep Copying:** Serialization can be used to create deep copies of objects.

## Mechanism
In Java, serialization is typically achieved using the `java.io.Serializable` interface. An object is serialized by converting it to a sequence of bytes using `ObjectOutputStream` and deserialized using `ObjectInputStream`.

### Serialization
1. **Implement `Serializable`:** The class of the object to be serialized must implement the `Serializable` interface.
2. **Use `ObjectOutputStream`:** Create an `ObjectOutputStream` to write the object to an output stream.

### Deserialization
1. **Use `ObjectInputStream`:** Create an `ObjectInputStream` to read the object from an input stream.
2. **Cast the Object:** Cast the deserialized object back to its original type.

### Conclusion
In this R&D report, we have explored the Serialization and Deserialization process, highlighting its benefits and mechanism. 
The example code [https://github.com/ApsaraWitharana/AAD-Assignment-1.git]  snippet demonstrates the process in Java, and the GitHub repository provides a reference implementation.
